## Development & Support

The application is a solo project. Despite a few contributions by friends on the graphics front,
the development of both the plugin and application is all done by one person.

Behind everything, support, bug fixing, social media presence there is a single person.
I try to answer your requests but some times it might take a while so please be patient.

This project is something that happens on my free time. This means that
 even if I love adding features and improving the application, real life obligations
 along with work obligations are always prioritized.
