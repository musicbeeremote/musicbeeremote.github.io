Hi everyone,

This morning [v1.1.0](https://github.com/kelsos/mbrc/releases/tag/v1.1.0) was pushed to the beta channel on Play store.
If you are a beta tester you probably already received the update
on your phone. There are a couple of changes that also require
the latest version of the [plugin (v1.1.0)](https://github.com/kelsos/mbrc-plugin/releases/tag/v1.1.0).

You can find a complete changelog on [Github](https://github.com/kelsos/mbrc/blob/v1.1.x/CHANGELOG.md).

The plans are to have the v1.1.0 in the beta channel until the end of the week.
If there are no major issues, the plan is to release the new version to the production
channel by the end of the week.


Soon I will start working on the next update [v1.2.0](https://github.com/kelsos/mbrc/milestone/3) of the application
that will contain mostly new features.
